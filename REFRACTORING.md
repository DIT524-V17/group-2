# Refractoring rules

## Installing
    Install SourceMonitor
    Create a Java analyse project
    Import the guard app
		
#### Thresholds
Maximums:
LOC (Lines of code) - Not a real maximum, a high amount might be more error prone.
Cyclomatic complexity - 15
Block Depth - 7
If any of these thresholds are met add the Class to trello for critical refractoring, also add as issue on github.

#### Who does what?
During code review, we will know which classes have to highest complexity. Who should refactor the specified class is decided on as a group. 
#### When?
During friday code reviews. If the refactoring is critical, make the changes ASAP.
