- smartcar_GPS. Run on start-up of the Pi. Gets SmartCar's coordinates

- drive. Run on start-up of the Pi. Logic for self driving. Also triggers the Arduino to change mode (GPSfollowing/manual control)

- set_coords_phone. Takes two args (lat & long), and sets them as coordinates for the phone (in case of invalid number of arguments, lat is set to '1' (no fix)).
	example: 1. ssh pi@192.168.1.105 (psw: raspberry)
		 2. python home/pi/repo/group-2/GPSfollowing/set_coords_phone 54.327 11.244		 
	
	when received lat =  0, terminate script (sends command to SmartCar to stop and exits)
			     1, bad GPS signal (sends command to SmartCar to stop 
						and awaits an actual coordinate before continuing)
			     2, change to manual control mode (sends command to SmartCar)
			     3, change to GPSfollowing mode (sends command to SmartCar)
