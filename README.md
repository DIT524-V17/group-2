# G.U.A.R.D
This is the G.U.A.R.D Project, a WIP SmartCar based on [Smartcar](http://plat.is/smartcar) Arduino library. 
 The main goal of this particular SmartCar is; a SmartCar that has the functionallity of getting to a person by GPS-tracking, a camera feed on an analog controller and obstacle avoidence using lidar technology with a SLAM algorithm.
## Getting started
Not fully ready for getting started on your own, some hardware specs is missing at the moment.
### Prerequisites
Android studio
Android phone with wifi and bluetooth capabilities.
#### Hardware used:

Arduino board: MEGA 2560
Lidar: Lidar Lite v3
Bluetooth Module: HC-05
6x Ultra sonic sensors: SR-04
Arduino Power: 12V battery pack 
Power bridge: L293D H-bridge

Raspberry Pi: 3 model B
GPS Module: GlobalSat BU-353
Camera: Picamera v2
RBPi power: 10050 mAh powerbank

### Installing
Arduino schematics:

## Running the tests
Install the APK through android studio, with this you can test the application even without a SmartCar.
Run the InstrumentedTestSuite.java.
