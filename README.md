# G.U.A.R.D
This is the G.U.A.R.D Project, a SmartCar based on [Smartcar](http://plat.is/smartcar) Arduino library. 
 The main goal of this particular SmartCar is; a SmartCar that has the functionallity of getting to a person by GPS-tracking, a camera feed on an analog controller and obstacle avoidence using LIDAR technology with a SLAM algorithm.
## Getting started
Not fully ready for getting started on your own, some hardware specs is missing at the moment.
### Prerequisites
Android studio
Android phone with wifi and bluetooth capabilities running on atleast Android 4.4.
SmartCar as specified by Dimitris Platis in the [Smartcar](http://plat.is/smartcar) library. 
#### Hardware used:

Arduino board: MEGA 2560

LIDAR: LIDAR-Lite v3

Bluetooth Module: HC-05

6x Ultra sonic sensors: SR-04

Arduino Power: 12V battery pack (8x AA batteries)

Power bridge: L293D H-bridge

Raspberry Pi: 3 model B

GPS Module: GlobalSat BU-353

Camera: Picamera v2

RBPi power: 10050 mAh powerbank

### Installing

## Running the tests
Install the APK through android studio, with this you can test the application even without a SmartCar.
Run the InstrumentedTestSuite.java.
